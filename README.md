# Multiclass Classification

Classification is a supervised machine learning method where the model tries to predict the correct label of a given input data. In classification, the model is fully trained using the training data, and then it is evaluated on test data before being used to perform prediction on new unseen data.

## Dataset and it's Features

Can you predict if customer is going to cancel the reservation ?
A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests, but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. A Kaggle Hotel Reservations Dataset is used for the project. It has 36275 entries, 19 columns. One of them (booking_status) is the target column, 12 features columns with data type of integer or float and 3 features columns with data type of object. One column - Booking_ID - was dropped.
